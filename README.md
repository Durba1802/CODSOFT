# To-do list application
## Overview
A To-Do List App is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users manage their tasks and stay organized. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, providing a clear overview of what needs to be done. 

## Development Using Tkinter in Python
The To-Do List App is built using Tkinter, a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library in Python. Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. The app consists of various components such as entry fields for task input, buttons for adding and removing tasks, and a listbox to display the tasks.

### Key Features
1. Add Tasks: Users can easily add new tasks to their list by entering the task name and clicking the 'Add' button.
2. Remove Tasks: Users can select tasks from the list and remove them by clicking the 'Remove' button.
3. Clear All Tasks: Users can clear all tasks from the list with a single click.
4. User-Friendly Interface: The app features a clean and intuitive interface that makes task management straightforward and efficient.
